# The Audit Of Will

The Audit of Will is a diagnostic lens that reveals how organizations create trust or harm through their daily decisions.

It is not a survey.
It is not a culture deck.
It is a pattern-recognition tool built for leaders who want to see their system clearly.

### INTRODUCTION — THE LENS THAT REVEALS

Five dimensions, twenty-five questions, one score.

Run quarterly or annually on public data alone — no cooperation required.

### THE FIVE DIMENSIONS

1. DIRECTION — Do repeated decisions reinforce or erode stated purpose?
2. BURDEN — Who carries the weight of the system’s choices?
3. COHERENCE — Do actions match claims and incentives?
4. ACCOUNTABILITY — Does authority carry the consequences it creates?
5. RISK — What visible drift patterns remain unaddressed?

Each dimension: 0–5 (5 = strong coherence, 0 = extraction)

Total score out of 25 determines quadrant position.

### QUADRANT MAPPING

≥ 20 → Stewardship (I)  
14–19 → Unexamined Drift (II)  
9–13 → Performance (III)  
≤ 8 → Extraction (IV)

### LIVE EXAMPLES (29 Nov 2025)

Tesla          1/25 → Extraction  
Amazon         1/25 → Extraction  
Apple         11/25 → Drift  
Patagonia      23/25 → Stewardship  
Costco        18/25 → Drift (improving)

### HOW TO RUN IT

Anyone can execute the full 25-question audit using only public sources:
- Regulatory filings
- Earnings call transcripts
- Employee reviews (Blind/Glassdoor)
- Court documents
- News archives
- Whistleblower reports

No internal access needed.

### WHY IT WORKS

The audit measures structural reality, not declared intention.
Contradictions surface immediately.
Deflection becomes visible.
Drift can no longer hide behind narrative.

Leaders who use it privately regain clarity.
Those who ignore it eventually face it publicly.
