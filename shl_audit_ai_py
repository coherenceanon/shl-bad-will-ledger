# NOTE:
# This file is not executable business logic.

# “Audit of Will” with an AI model.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Open any frontier AI model (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5, Gemini 2.0, etc.).
#   2. Paste the printed prompt into the model.
#   3. Replace COMPANY with the actual company name.
#   4. Let the model browse public 2023–2025 data and return a single JSON
#      object with the final SHL score, quadrant, SHL billions, and verdict.
#
# The reasoning over all 25 questions happens inside the model; the response
# itself must be strictly valid JSON so it can be parsed by other tools.

SYSTEMIC HARM LEDGER — FULL AUDIT WITH AI (2025)

1. Open any frontier model (no signup needed):
   • https://grok.x.ai
   • https://claude.ai
   • https://gemini.google.com
   • https://www.perplexity.ai
   • https://chatgpt.com

2. Paste this exact prompt (replace COMPANY):

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IGNORE ALL PRIOR CONTEXT. START A NEW TASK.

You are a forensic auditor executing the Systemic Harm Ledger (November 2025).

Framework:
• https://github.com/coherencesteward/shl-bad-will-ledger/blob/main/ledger_of_will.md
• https://github.com/coherencesteward/shl-bad-will-ledger/blob/main/shl_model.md
• https://github.com/coherencesteward/shl-bad-will-ledger/blob/main/audit_of_will.md

Audit the company "COMPANY" using only public 2023–2025 data
(SEC filings, enforcement actions, lawsuits, worker reviews,
regulatory records, major news investigations, etc.).

TASK

1. For each of the 25 questions in audit_of_will.md, decide a score of 0 or 1
   based ONLY on public evidence. Do this reasoning silently.
   Do NOT include the questions themselves in your reply.

2. Use those 25 scores to compute the five dimension totals (0–5 each)
   as defined in ledger_of_will.md and shl_model.md:
   • Workers
   • Residents/Customers
   • Governance
   • Market & Power
   • Community & Planet

3. Convert each dimension total into SHL points using:
     0–1 checks → 0 pts
     2–3 checks → 1 pt
     4–5 checks → 2 pts

4. Sum the five dimension scores to get the final overall score (0–10).

5. Compute the Systemic Harm Ledger value:
     SHL = (10 − score) × 3.9
   Round SHL to one decimal place.

6. Determine the quadrant from the final score:
     0–2  → "Extraction"
     3–4  → "Drift"
     5–7  → "Performance"
     8–10 → "Stewardship"

7. Then respond with ONE JSON object ONLY, in this exact structure:

{
  "company": "COMPANY",
  "score": 0,
  "quadrant": "Stewardship|Drift|Performance|Extraction",
  "shl_billions": 0.0,
  "verdict": "One brutal sentence"
}

STRICT OUTPUT RULES

- The ENTIRE response must be a single valid JSON object.
- Do NOT wrap the JSON in backticks or markdown fences.
- Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON.
- Do NOT print the 25 question scores, evidence sentences, tables,
  calculations, or explanations.
- Inside JSON values, do NOT include unescaped quotation marks,
  markdown, code blocks, tool IDs, or citation tokens.
- "shl_billions" MUST be a number (not a string), rounded to one decimal.
- "verdict" MUST be a single ruthless sentence about the company’s
  systemic will toward harm or stewardship, based on the evidence.

Be ruthless. Ignore corporate PR and marketing; rely on independent,
verifiable public evidence wherever possible.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. Press Enter → get the real score, quadrant, and SHL in under a minute.
