#   1. Run this script to print the prompt.
#   2. Copy the printed text into any frontier AI model (GPT-5.1, Claude 3.5, Gemini, etc.).
#   3. Replace COMPANY with the actual company name.
#   4. Paste in or allow the model to search public 2023–2025 data.
#   5. The model must respond with a single clean JSON object that can be parsed.
#
# The model SHOULD NOT return the 25 question scores or evidence — only the

SYSTEMIC HARM LEDGER — AI AUDIT PROMPT (2025)

1. Open any frontier model (no signup needed), for example:
   • https://chatgpt.com
   • https://claude.ai
   • https://gemini.google.com
   • https://www.perplexity.ai
   • https://grok.x.ai

2. Paste this exact prompt (replace COMPANY):

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
IGNORE PRIOR CONTEXT. NEW TASK.

You are a forensic auditor for the Systemic Harm Ledger (November 2025).

Framework:
- https://github.com/coherencesteward/shl-bad-will-ledger/blob/main/ledger_of_will.md
- https://github.com/coherencesteward/shl-bad-will-ledger/blob/main/shl_model.md
- https://github.com/coherencesteward/shl-bad-will-ledger/blob/main/audit_of_will.md

Audit the company "COMPANY" using ONLY 2023–2025 public data
(SEC and other filings, lawsuits, press, regulation, credible news,
government reports, and large review aggregators).

TASK:
1. Silently score each of the 25 questions in audit_of_will.md as 0 or 1
   based strictly on evidence (no guessing, no benefit of the doubt).
2. Aggregate the 25 binary scores into the 5 dimensions:
   - Workers
   - Residents/Customers
   - Governance
   - Market & Power
   - Community & Planet
   Each dimension total is between 0 and 5.
3. Convert each dimension total to SHL points:
   - 0–1 checks → 0 pts
   - 2–3 checks → 1 pt
   - 4–5 checks → 2 pts
4. Sum the 5 dimension point totals to get the overall SHL score (0–10).
5. Compute SHL (Systemic Harm Load) in billions:
   SHL = (10 - score) × 3.9
   Round SHL to 1 decimal place.
6. Determine the quadrant from the final score:
   - 0–2  → "Extraction"
   - 3–5  → "Drift"
   - 6–8  → "Performance"
   - 9–10 → "Stewardship"

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond ONLY with a single valid JSON object:

{
  "company": "COMPANY",
  "score": 0,
  "quadrant": "QUADRANT",
  "shl_billions": 0.0,
  "verdict": "Brutal sentence"
}

RULES:
- Output MUST be a single JSON object, no surrounding text.
- No code fences, no markdown, no comments, no trailing commas.
- Do NOT include the 25 question scores, evidence, tables, or explanations.
- Do NOT include citations, links, or footnotes in the JSON.
- Use standard ASCII quotes only (no smart quotes).
- "company" and "quadrant" are strings.
- "score" is an integer between 0 and 10.
- "shl_billions" is a number (not a string), rounded to 1 decimal.
- "verdict" is one ruthless, plain-language sentence summarizing the
  company’s systemic harm or stewardship based on the evidence.
- Be ruthless, ignore corporate PR, and base everything on verifiable evidence.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

3. Press Enter → the model should return a single clean JSON object you can
   drop straight into a parser, spreadsheet, or code.
